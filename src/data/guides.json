Then sell your current pickaxe to recover gold. This lets you keep mining while freeing up funds to afford the next tier faster.\n\nRune Tip: Only apply runes to the Arcane Pickaxe. Equip all 3 Luck Runes for maximum luck (up to 16% bonus each).\n\nEarning Money for Arcane Pickaxe: Complete Monkey Quest, Line's Quest, and work on Rowan's and Moro's quests. Farm high-tier mobs for Essence or forge/sell Heavy Armor/Colossal Swords."
